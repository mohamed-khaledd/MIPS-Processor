# Single-Cycle MIPS Processor

## Overview
This project implements a single-cycle MIPS processor using Verilog HDL. The processor supports a subset of the MIPS instruction set and executes instructions in a single cycle.

## Key Features
- **Single-Cycle Execution**: Each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle.
- **Instruction Set**: Supports addition, subtraction, load/store, Jump, and branch instructions.
- **Modular Design**: Includes separate modules for ALU, Control Unit, Register File, and Memory.
